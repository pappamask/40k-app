redeploy_text = '''Change the set up of one third of your operatives  
(rounding up).'''

reposition_text = '''Perform a free Reposition action with one friendly operative  
that’s wholly within your drop zone. It must end that move  
wholly within 3" of your drop zone.'''


trip_alarm_text = '''Place one of your Trip Alarm markers more than 6" from your  
opponent’s drop zone. During the first and second turning  
point, whenever a friendly SCOUT SQUAD operative is  
shooting an enemy operative that’s within 2" of that marker,  
that friendly operative’s ranged weapons have the Seek  
weapon rule. In the Ready step of the third Strategy phase,  
remove that marker.'''

booby_trap_text = '''Place one of your Booby Trap markers more than 6" from your  
opponent’s drop zone and more than 2" from other markers,  
access points and Accessible terrain. The first time your  
Booby Trap marker is within an enemy operative’s control  
range, remove that marker and inflict 2D3 damage on that  
operative; if it isn’t incapacitated, end its action (if any), even  
if that action’s effects aren’t fulfilled. If it cannot be placed,  
move it the minimum amount to do so.'''

operative within 6" of a killzone edge. Until the end of that  
operative’s next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat.'''

devise_plan_text = '''You gain 1CP.'''

designate_target_text = '''Select one enemy operative to gain one of your Target tokens.  
Whenever a friendly SCOUT SQUAD operative is shooting  
against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy  
operative that has one of your Target tokens, you can re-roll  
one of your attack dice.'''

spy_text = '''Approved Ops only. Your opponent must reveal their selected  
tac op.'''

tactical_manoeuvre_text = '''Once per battle STRATEGIC GAMBIT. Select one friendly  
operative. Until the end of that operative’s next activation, add

<small>_Space Marine Scouts learn to use terrain to their advantage,
preventing the enemy from getting a bead on them as they move within
killing range._</small>
            
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly SCOUT
SQUAD operative, if that friendly operative is in cover and
more than 6" from enemy operatives it’s visible to, you can
re-roll one of your defence dice

gunfire_ambush_text = '''
:violet-background[GUNFIRE AMBUSH]\n
            
<small>_Scout Squads utilise stealth to close within range of their foes, carefully
select their targets and unleash a devastating barrage of bolt rounds and
shotgun slugs._</small>
            
Whenever a friendly SCOUT SQUAD operative is shooting
during its activation, if its order was changed from Conceal
to Engage at the start of that activation, or it wasn’t visible to
enemy operatives at the start of that activation:
 - That friendly operative’s ranged weapons have the
Balanced weapon rule.
 - If the target is expended, that friendly operative’s ranged
weapons have the Ceaseless weapon rule instead.
'''

blade_ambush_text = '''
:violet-background[BLADE AMBUSH]\n
            
<small>_At times when stealth is of the utmost importance, the blade is
preferable to the bolter, and just as deadly._</small>
            
Whenever a friendly SCOUT SQUAD operative is fighting
during its activation, if its order was changed from Conceal
to Engage at the start of that activation, or it wasn’t visible to
enemy operatives at the start of that activation:
 - That friendly operative’s melee weapons have the Ceaseless
weapon rule.
 - If the target is expended, that friendly operative’s melee
weapons also have the Rending weapon rule.

<small>_Space Marine Scout Squads are highly mobile units, shifting swiftly from
cover to cover in order to outmanoeuvre the foe._</small>
            
Select one friendly SCOUT SQUAD operative more than
6" from enemy operatives. That friendly operative can
immediately perform a free Dash action and/or you can
change its order. 
'''

astartes_training_text = '''
:red-background[ASTARTES TRAINING]\n
            
<small>_Space Marine Chapters are amongst the galaxy’s most elite fighting
forces. Even their Neophytes wield their weapons with peerless skill._</small>
            
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly SCOUT SQUAD
operative’s activation. Until the end of that activation, that
operative can either perform two Fight actions, or two Shoot
actions if an Astartes shotgun, bolt pistol or boltgun is
selected for at least one of them.
'''

raw_physiology_text = '''
:red-background[RAW PHYSIOLOGY]\n
            
<small>_Though their training may not yet be complete, Space Marine Scouts
possess the same genetically augmented resilience as their fully
fledged battle-brothers._</small>
            
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly SCOUT SQUAD
operative’s activation. Until the start of its next activation, you
can ignore any changes to that operative’s stats from being
injured (including its weapons’ stats).
'''

emboldened_aspirant_text = '''
:red-background[EMBOLDENED ASPIRANT]\n
            
<small>_Surgical enhancement, indoctrination and brutal training instil within
a Space Marine Neophyte the confidence and determination to battle
powerful foes_</small>
            
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly SCOUT SQUAD
operative performs the Shoot or Fight action, at the end of
the Roll Attack Dice step. If it’s the first friendly operative to
perform either of those actions during this turning point, or if
the enemy operative in that action (primary target, if relevant)
has a higher Wounds stat than it, that friendly operative’s
weapons have the Severe weapon rule until the end of
that action.
'''

covert_position_text = '''
:red-background[COVERT POSITION]\n
            
<small>_Space Marine Scouts excel at camouflaging themselves, laying in wait
for hours or even days at a time until they identify the perfect moment
to strike._</small>
            
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly SCOUT SQUAD
operative’s activation. Until the start of its next activation,
while that operative has a Conceal order and is in cover,
it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence
over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being
within 2”.
